# BCH Helper

This is an AutoHotKey helper program used to speed up processes in the Bristol Community Health  Application Support Team. We use EMIS, and reset passwords often - so this AutoHotKey program helps with processes such as that.

To install for your own use, simply download and run the main executable:

[BCH Helper.exe](BCH Helper.exe)

The program will run in the tray and if you right click on the icon, choose "Instructions" menu,  you will see the list of commands.

To restart the program use `Ctrl+Esc` key.

To quit the program use `Ctrl+Shift+Esc` key.
